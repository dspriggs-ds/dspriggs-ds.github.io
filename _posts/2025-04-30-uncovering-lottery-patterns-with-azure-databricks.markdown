Have you ever wondered if there’s a pattern in lottery numbers? While randomness is the foundation of lotteries, exploring past draws with modern data tools can still reveal some interesting trends—or at least sharpen your data analysis skills.

In this blog post, I used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databricks/" target="_blank">Azure Databricks</a> to perform an exploratory data analysis of lottery numbers using PySpark. This hands-on project showcases how to import, clean, and explore historical lottery data using the power of the cloud.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective was to:

- Analyze past lottery draws
- Identify the most frequent numbers
- Understand number distribution patterns
- Visualize trends over time

The analysis was done entirely in a Databricks Notebook, utilizing PySpark for scalable data processing.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databricks/" target="_blank">Azure Databricks</a>
- <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/" target="_blank">PySpark</a>
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a> for visualization
- Historical lottery CSV files as the data source

## 🔍 What the Notebook Does

1. **Load and Parse the Data**  
   The notebook reads a CSV file containing historical lottery draws. It parses the draw dates and winning numbers, transforming them into a structured format for analysis.

2. **Frequency Analysis**  
   By flattening the number columns, the notebook calculates how often each number has appeared. The result is a sorted list showing the most frequently drawn numbers.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   Using bar charts and line plots, the notebook visualizes:
   - Top 10 most frequent numbers
   - Number frequency distribution
   - Draw frequency over time

4. **Bonus: Pattern Exploration**  
   The analysis even digs into whether certain number ranges (e.g., 1–10, 11–20, etc.) occur more frequently, adding a fun pattern-hunting element.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Some numbers appear significantly more often than others.
- Distribution is not perfectly uniform—likely due to sample size or biases in early draws.
- Time-based trends, while subtle, can be interesting to explore (e.g., draw frequency anomalies).

> ⚠️ Of course, this is not a strategy to win the lottery! This project is meant to sharpen data processing and visualization skills, not predict the future.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Projects like this are great practice for:
- Working with semi-structured data
- Performing aggregation and ranking
- Creating impactful visual summaries

It’s a fun and practical way to build comfort with <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Spark</a> and data exploration in the cloud.
